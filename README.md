## About

Better Upload is a file upload library for React that makes it very simple and easy to upload files directly to any S3-compatible service.

While Better Upload is designed to work with Next.js, it can also work with any framework / backend server that uses standard Request and Response objects. Like [Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Hono](https://hono.dev/)!

It comes with copy-and-paste [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) components that you can use to rapidly build UI.

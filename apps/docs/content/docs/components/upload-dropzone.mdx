## Usage

The `<UploadDropzone />` should be used inside a client component.

```tsx
'use client';

import { UploadDropzone } from '@/components/ui/upload-dropzone';
```

```tsx
<UploadDropzone
  route="demo"
  accept="image/*"
  onBeforeUpload={({ files }) => {
    // rename all files
    return files.map(
      (file) => new File([file], 'renamed-' + file.name, { type: file.type })
    );
  }}
  onUploadBegin={({ files, metadata }) => {
    console.log('Upload begin');
  }}
  onUploadProgress={({ file, progress }) => {
    console.log(`Progress of ${file.name}: ${progress * 100}%`);
  }}
  onUploadComplete={({ files, metadata }) => {
    console.log(`Uploaded ${files.length} files`);
  }}
  onUploadError={(error) => {
    console.log(error.message);
  }}
  onUploadSettled={() => {
    console.log('Upload settled');
  }}
/>
```

<Callout>
  If your upload route handler is not located at `/api/upload`, modify the `api`
  prop to match your path.
</Callout>

When clicked, the dropzone will open a file picker dialog. When selected or dropped, the files will be uploaded to the desired route.

### Description

You can customize the description shown in the dropzone. You can pass a string, or an object with the following properties:

- `maxFiles`: The maximum number of files that can be uploaded.
- `maxFileSize`: The maximum size of the files that can be uploaded, use a formatted string (e.g. `10MB`).
- `fileTypes`: The file types that can be uploaded.

```tsx
<UploadDropzone
  route="demo"
  accept="image/*"
  description={{
    maxFiles: 4,
    maxFileSize: '2MB',
    fileTypes: 'JPEG, PNG, GIF',
  }}
/>
```

Note that this is only cosmetic and does not enforce any restrictions client-side.

## Usage

<Callout>
  If you did not create your Route Handler on `/api/upload`, modify `api` on the
  hook in the component to match your path.
</Callout>

The `<UploadDropzone />` should be used inside a client component.

```tsx
'use client';

import { UploadDropzone } from '@/components/ui/upload-dropzone';
```

```tsx
<UploadDropzone
  route="demo"
  accept="image/*"
  onUploadComplete={({ files }) => {
    console.log(`${files.length} files uploaded.`);
  }}
/>
```

When clicked, the dropzone will open a file picker dialog. When selected or dropped, the files will be uploaded to the desired route.

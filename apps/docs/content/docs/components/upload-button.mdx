## Usage

The `<UploadButton />` should be used inside a client component.

```tsx
'use client';

import { UploadButton } from '@/components/ui/upload-button';
```

```tsx
<UploadButton
  route="demo"
  accept="image/*"
  onBeforeUpload={({ file }) => {
    // rename the file
    return new File([file], 'renamed-' + file.name, { type: file.type });
  }}
  onUploadBegin={({ file, metadata }) => {
    console.log('Upload begin');
  }}
  onUploadProgress={({ file, progress }) => {
    console.log(`Upload progress: ${progress * 100}%`);
  }}
  onUploadComplete={({ file, metadata }) => {
    console.log('Upload complete');
  }}
  onUploadError={(error) => {
    console.log(error.message);
  }}
  onUploadSettled={() => {
    console.log('Upload settled');
  }}
/>
```

<Callout>
  If your upload route handler is not located at `/api/upload`, modify the `api`
  prop to match your path.
</Callout>

The button will open a file picker dialog when clicked, and upload the selected file to the desired route.

## Usage

The `<UploadButton />` should be used inside a client component.

```tsx
'use client';

import { UploadButton } from '@/components/ui/upload-button';
```

```tsx
<UploadButton
  route="demo"
  accept="image/*"
  onUploadComplete={({ file }) => {
    console.log('File uploaded.');
  }}
/>
```

The button will open a file picker dialog when clicked, and upload the selected file to the desired route.

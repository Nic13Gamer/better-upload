## Installation

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install the following dependencies:

```package-install
lucide-react
```

Also add the [shadcn/ui button](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/button) component to your project. As the upload button is built on top of it.

</Step>

<Step>

### Copy and paste the following code into your project.

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./components/templates/upload-button.txt",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "tsx"
  }
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Update the import paths to match your project setup.

</Steps>

## Usage

<Callout>
  If you did not create your Route Handler on `/api/upload`, modify `api` on the
  hook in the component to match your path.
</Callout>

The `<UploadButton />` should be used inside a client component.

```tsx
'use client';

import { UploadButton } from '@/components/ui/upload-button';
```

```tsx
<UploadButton
  route="demo"
  accept="image/*"
  onUploadComplete={({ file }) => {
    console.log('File uploaded.');
  }}
/>
```

The button will open a file picker dialog when clicked, and upload the selected file to the desired route.

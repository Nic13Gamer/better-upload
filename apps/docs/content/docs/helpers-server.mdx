## S3 Clients

Better Upload has built-in clients for popular S3-compatible storage services, like AWS S3 and Cloudflare R2. Suggest a new client by [opening an issue](https://github.com/Nic13Gamer/better-upload/issues).

<include cwd>./components/mdx/helpers-server.mdx#s3-clients</include>

<Callout>
  You can omit the parameters and let the client get your credentials from
  environment variables.
</Callout>

## Objects

Helpers for working with objects in S3-compatible storage services. Suggest new helpers by [opening an issue](https://github.com/Nic13Gamer/better-upload/issues).

### Presign get object

Generate a pre-signed URL to download an object.

```ts
import { presignGetObject } from '@better-upload/server/helpers';

const url = await presignGetObject(s3, {
  bucket: 'my-bucket',
  key: 'example.png',
  expiresIn: 3600, // 1 hour
});
```

### Get object

Get an object (including its content) from an S3 bucket.

```ts
import { getObject } from '@better-upload/server/helpers';

const object = await getObject(s3, {
  bucket: 'my-bucket',
  key: 'example.png',
});
```

### Head object

Get metadata about an object without fetching its content.

```ts
import { headObject } from '@better-upload/server/helpers';

const object = await headObject(s3, {
  bucket: 'my-bucket',
  key: 'example.png',
});
```

### Move object (rename)

Move an object from one key to another, within or between, S3 buckets. Also known as renaming.

```ts
import { moveObject } from '@better-upload/server/helpers';

await moveObject(s3, {
  source: {
    bucket: 'source-bucket',
    key: 'example.png',
  },
  destination: {
    bucket: 'destination-bucket',
    key: 'copy.png',
  },
});
```

<Callout type="warn">
  This copies the object to the new location and then deletes the original
  object. It can be slow.
</Callout>

### Copy object

Copy an object, within or between, S3 buckets.

```ts
import { copyObject } from '@better-upload/server/helpers';

await copyObject(s3, {
  source: {
    bucket: 'source-bucket',
    key: 'example.png',
  },
  destination: {
    bucket: 'destination-bucket',
    key: 'images/example.png',
  },
});
```

### Delete object

Delete an object from an S3 bucket.

```ts
import { deleteObject } from '@better-upload/server/helpers';

await deleteObject(s3, {
  bucket: 'my-bucket',
  key: 'example.png',
});
```

## S3 Clients

`better-upload` has some built-in clients for popular S3-compatible storage services, like Cloudflare R2. Suggest a new client by [opening an issue](https://github.com/Nic13Gamer/better-upload/issues).

### Cloudflare R2

```ts
import { r2 } from 'better-upload/server/helpers';

const client = r2({
  accountId: 'your-account-id',
  accessKeyId: 'your-access-key-id',
  secretAccessKey: 'your-secret-access-key',
});
```

This returns an instance of an S3 Client from the AWS SDK, just like `new S3Client()`, but already configured for Cloudflare R2.

#### Jurisdiction

If you created your R2 bucket using a jurisdiction, you can specify it here.

```ts
import { r2 } from 'better-upload/server/helpers';

const client = r2({
  accountId: 'your-account-id',
  accessKeyId: 'your-access-key-id',
  secretAccessKey: 'your-secret-access-key',
  jurisdiction: 'eu', // [!code highlight]
});
```

### Minio

```ts
import { minio } from 'better-upload/server/helpers';

const client = minio({
  region: 'your-minio-region',
  endpoint: 'https://minio.example.com'
  accessKeyId: 'your-access-key-id',
  secretAccessKey: 'your-secret-access-key',
});
```

## Bucket Objects

### Move object (rename)

Moves an object from one location to another, within the same bucket. Also known as renaming.

```ts
import { moveObject } from 'better-upload/server/helpers';

await moveObject({
  client: r2(),
  bucketName: 'your-bucket-name',
  objectKey: 'example.jpg',
  destinationKey: 'images/example.jpg',
});
```

<Callout type="warn">
  This copies the object to the new location and then deletes the original
  object. It can be slow.
</Callout>

## Client-side

There are also some helpers for your frontend.

### Readable bytes

Convert bytes to a human-readable format.

```ts
import { readableBytes } from 'better-upload/client/helpers';

readableBytes(1000); // "1 kB"
readableBytes(1000, { decimalPlaces: 2 }); // "1.00 kB"

readableBytes(1024, { si: false }); // "1 KiB"
readableBytes(1024, { decimalPlaces: 2, si: false }); // "1.00 KiB"
```

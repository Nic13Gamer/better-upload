## S3 Clients

`better-upload` has some built-in clients for popular S3-compatible storage services. Currently, the following are available:

- Cloudflare R2

Here's how you can use the **R2** client:

```ts
import { r2 } from 'better-upload/server/helpers';

const client = r2({
  accountId: 'your-account-id',
  accessKeyId: 'your-access-key-id',
  secretAccessKey: 'your-secret-access-key',
});
```

This returns an instance of an S3 Client from the AWS SDK, just like `new S3Client()`, but already configured for Cloudflare R2.

## Bucket Objects

### Move object

Moves an object from one location to another, within the same bucket.

```ts
import { moveObject } from 'better-upload/server/helpers';

await moveObject({
  client: r2(),
  bucketName: 'your-bucket-name',
  objectKey: 'example.jpg',
  destinationKey: 'images/example.jpg',
});
```

<Callout type="warn">
  This copies the object to the new location and then deletes the original
  object. It can be slow.
</Callout>

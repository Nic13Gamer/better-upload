title: Client Hooks
---

Better Upload provides React hooks that allow you to easily upload files using pre-signed URLs. Multipart uploads are managed automatically, in case you enable them in the server.

## Usage

```tsx tab="Single file"
import { useUploadFile } from 'better-upload/client';

export function MyComponent() {
  const {
    upload,
    uploadAsync,
    reset,
    uploadedFile,
    progress,
    isPending,
    isSettled,
    isError,
    isSuccess,
    error,
    metadata,
    control, // for use in pre-built components
  } = useUploadFile({
    route: 'demo',
  });

  return (
    <input
      type="file"
      onChange={(e) => {
        if (e.target.files?.[0]) {
          upload(e.target.files[0]);
        }
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

```tsx tab="Multiple files"
import { useUploadFiles } from 'better-upload/client';

export function MyComponent() {
  const {
    upload,
    uploadAsync,
    reset,
    uploadedFiles,
    failedFiles,
    progresses,
    isPending,
    isSettled,
    isError,
    allSucceeded,
    hasFailedFiles,
    averageProgress,
    error,
    metadata,
    control, // for use in pre-built components
  } = useUploadFiles({
    route: 'demo',
  });

  return (
    <input
      type="file"
      multiple
      onChange={(e) => {
        if (e.target.files) {
          upload(e.target.files);
        }
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

<Callout>
  If your upload route handler is not located at `/api/upload`, you need to
  specify the correct path in the `api` option.
</Callout>

### Options

Both hooks have the following options:

- `api`: The API endpoint to use for uploading files. Default is `/api/upload`.
- `route`: The route to use for uploading files. Needs to match the upload route in the server.
- `multipartBatchSize`: The number of parts to upload at the same time when uploading a multipart file. By default, all parts are uploaded simultaneously.
- `signal`: The `AbortSignal` to use for cancelling the upload.
- `headers`: The headers to send with the pre-signed URL request to your server.

For multiple files, you can also specify:

- `uploadBatchSize`: The number of files to upload in parallel. By default, all files are uploaded simultaneously.

## Events

### On before upload

Callback that is called before requesting the pre-signed URLs. Use this to modify the files before uploading them, like resizing or compressing. You can also throw an error to reject the file upload.

<Tabs groupId="multipleFiles" items={['Single file', 'Multiple files']}>
<Tab value="Single file">
```tsx
useUploadFile({
  route: 'demo',
  onBeforeUpload: ({ file }) => {
    // rename the file
    return new File([file], 'renamed-' + file.name, { type: file.type })
  },
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Multiple files">
```tsx
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onBeforeUpload: ({ files }) => {
    // rename all files
    return files.map(
      (file) => new File([file], 'renamed-' + file.name, { type: file.type }),
    );
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### On upload begin

Event that is called before the files start being uploaded to S3. This happens after the server responds with the pre-signed URL.

<Tabs groupId="multipleFiles" items={['Single file', 'Multiple files']}>
<Tab value="Single file">
```tsx
useUploadFile({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadBegin: ({ file, metadata }) => {
    console.log('Upload begin');
  },
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Multiple files">
```tsx
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadBegin: ({ files, metadata }) => {
    console.log('Upload begin');
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### On upload progress

Event that is called when a file upload progress changes.

<Tabs groupId="multipleFiles" items={['Single file', 'Multiple files']}>
<Tab value="Single file">
```tsx
useUploadFile({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadProgress: ({ file }) => {
    console.log(`Upload progress: ${file.progress * 100}%`);
  },
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Multiple files">
```tsx
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadProgress: ({ file }) => {
    console.log(`${file.name} upload progress: ${file.progress * 100}%`);
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### On upload complete

Event that is called after files are successfully uploaded.

<Tabs groupId="multipleFiles" items={['Single file', 'Multiple files']}>
<Tab value="Single file">
```tsx
useUploadFile({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadComplete: ({ file, metadata }) => {
    console.log('File uploaded');
  },
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Multiple files">
```tsx
// This event is called even if some files fail to upload, but some succeed.
// This event is not called if all files fail to upload.
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadComplete: ({ files, failedFiles, metadata }) => {
    console.log(`${files.length} files uploaded`);
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### On upload fail

Event that is called after the entire upload if a file fails to upload.

<Tabs groupId="multipleFiles" items={['Single file', 'Multiple files']}>
<Tab value="Single file">
```tsx
// Use onError instead of this event for single file uploads
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Multiple files">
```tsx
// This event is called even if some files succeed to upload, but some fail.
// This event is not called if all files succeed.
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadFail: ({ succeededFiles, failedFiles, metadata }) => {
    console.log('Some or all files failed to upload');
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### On error

Event that is called if:

- For multiple files: A critical error occurs before the upload to S3, and no files were able to be uploaded. For example, if your server is unreachable.
- For single file: The upload fails.

Also called if some input is invalid. For example, if no files were selected.

<Tabs groupId="multipleFiles" items={['Single file', 'Multiple files']}>
<Tab value="Single file">
```tsx
useUploadFile({
  route: 'demo',
  onError: (error) => {
    console.log(error.message);
  },
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Multiple files">
```tsx
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onError: (error) => {
    console.log(error.message);
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### On upload settle

Event that is called after the upload settles (either successfully completed or an error occurs).

<Tabs groupId="multipleFiles" items={['Single file', 'Multiple files']}>
<Tab value="Single file">
```tsx
useUploadFile({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadSettle: ({ file, metadata }) => {
    console.log('Upload settled');
  },
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Multiple files">
```tsx
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadSettle: ({ files, failedFiles, metadata }) => {
    console.log('Upload settled');
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

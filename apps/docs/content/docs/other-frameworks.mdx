Better Upload can work in any framework with API routes that use Request and Response objects. You can even use it in a separate backend server, like [Hono](https://hono.dev).

Here are some examples of how to use Better Upload in other frameworks:

## Full Stack

### Remix

TODO

### SvelteKit

TODO

## Backend

When using a different backend server, make sure to update the `api` option on the client hooks and components.

### Hono

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { handleRequest } from 'better-upload/server';

const app = new Hono();

app.post('/api/upload', (c) => {
  return handleRequest(c.req.raw, {
    // your Better Upload router config...
  });
});
```

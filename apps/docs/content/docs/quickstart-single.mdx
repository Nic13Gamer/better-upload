You can have file uploads in your React app in a few minutes with Better Upload. This guide will walk you through the steps to set it up with any React framework.

Before you start, make sure you have an S3-compatible bucket ready. You can use AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or any other S3-compatible service.

## Uploading your first image

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install

Install the `@better-upload/server` and `@better-upload/client` packages.

```npm
npm i @better-upload/server @better-upload/client
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Set up server

Your server generates pre-signed URLs, which the client uses to upload files directly to the S3 bucket.

Change `my-bucket` to your bucket name, and [choose your S3 client](/docs/helpers-server#s3-clients).

<include cwd>./components/mdx/quickstart/single.mdx#server</include>

In the example above, we create the upload route `profile`. Learn more about upload routes [here](/docs/routes-single).

<include cwd>./components/mdx/quickstart/single.mdx#server-accordions</include>

</Step>

<Step>

### Create `<Uploader />` component

We will now build our UI using pre-built components. We'll use `<UploadButton />` for single file uploads.

Install it via the [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) CLI:

```npm
npx shadcn@latest add @better-upload/upload-button
```

We'll also use the `useUploadFile` hook. The complete code looks like this:

```tsx title="uploader.tsx"
'use client'; // only for Next.js

import { useUploadFile } from '@better-upload/client';
import { UploadButton } from '@/components/ui/upload-button';

export function Uploader() {
  const { control } = useUploadFile({
    route: 'profile',
  });

  return <UploadButton control={control} accept="image/*" />;
}
```

Learn more about the hooks [here](/docs/hooks-single).

</Step>

<Step>

### Place the component

Now place the `<Uploader />` component in your app.

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { Uploader } from '@/components/uploader';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center">
      <Uploader />
    </main>
  );
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

### You're done! 🎉

You can now run your app and upload images directly to any S3-compatible service!

If you plan on uploading files larger than **5GB**, take a look at [multipart uploads](/docs/routes-single#multipart-uploads).

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="CORS Configuration">

Make sure to also correctly configure CORS on your bucket. Here is an example:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "http://localhost:3000",
      "https://example.com" // Add your domain here
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"]
  }
]
```

Learn more about CORS [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ManageCorsUsing.html).

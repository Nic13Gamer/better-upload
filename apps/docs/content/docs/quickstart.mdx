You can setup file upload in your Next.js app in a few minutes with Better Upload. If you are using another framework or a backend server, check out [Other Frameworks](/other-frameworks).

This guide will walk you through the steps to set it up with Next.js, but the steps are similar for other frameworks.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- A Next.js project.
- An S3-compatible bucket. You can use AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or any other.

## Uploading your first image

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install

Install the `better-upload` package, as well as the AWS S3 Client.

```package-install
better-upload @aws-sdk/client-s3
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Set up the Route Handler

The Route Handler will create pre-signed URLs, which the client uses to upload files directly to the S3 bucket. The recommended location for Next.js is `app/api/upload/route.ts`.

Change `your-bucket-name` to your S3 bucket name, and configure the S3 client as needed.

```ts title="app/api/upload/route.ts"
import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { createUploadRouteHandler, route } from 'better-upload/server';

const s3 = new S3Client(); // [!code highlight]

export const { POST } = createUploadRouteHandler({
  client: s3,
  bucketName: 'your-bucket-name', // [!code highlight]
  routes: {
    demo: route({
      fileTypes: ['image/*'],
    }),
  },
});
```

In the example above, we create the upload route `demo`. You can create routes for different purposes, like uploading multiple files at once. Learn more about upload routes [here](/routes).

</Step>

<Step>

### Create `<Uploader />` component

We will now build our UI using pre-built components. We'll use `<UploadButton />` for single file uploads.

Install it via the [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) CLI:

```package-install
npx shadcn@latest add "https://better-upload.js.org/r/upload-button.json"
```

We'll also use the `useUploadFile` hook. The complete code looks like this:

```tsx title="uploader.tsx"
'use client';

import { useUploadFile } from 'better-upload/client';
import { UploadButton } from '@/components/ui/upload-button';

export function Uploader() {
  const { control } = useUploadFile({
    route: 'demo',
  });

  return <UploadButton control={control} accept="image/*" />;
}
```

There is also `useUploadFiles` for uploading multiple files. Learn more about the hooks [here](/hooks).

</Step>

<Step>

### Place the component

Now place the `<Uploader />` component in your app.

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { Uploader } from '@/components/uploader';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center">
      <Uploader />
    </main>
  );
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

### You're done! ðŸŽ‰

You can now run your app and upload images directly to any S3-compatible service!

If you plan on uploading files larger than 5GB, take a look at [multipart uploads](/routes#multipart-uploads).

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="CORS Configuration">

Make sure to also correctly configure CORS on your bucket. Here is an example:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "http://localhost:3000",
      "https://example.com" // Add your domain here
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"]
  }
]
```

Learn more about CORS [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ManageCorsUsing.html).

You can setup file upload in your Next.js app in a few minutes with `next-upload`.

This guide will walk you through the steps to set it up.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- A Next.js project.
- An S3-compatible bucket. You can use AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or any other.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Install

Install the `next-upload` package, aswell as the AWS S3 Client.

```package-install
next-upload @aws-sdk/client-s3
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Set up the Route Handler

The Route Handler will create pre-signed URLs, which the client uses to upload files directly to the S3 bucket.

The recommended location is `app/api/upload/route.ts`, but you can place it anywhere you like.

Change `your-bucket-name` to your S3 bucket name, and configure the S3 client as needed.

```ts title="app/api/upload/route.ts"
import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { createUploadRouteHandler, route } from 'next-upload/server';

const s3 = new S3Client();

export const { POST } = createUploadRouteHandler({
  client: s3,
  bucketName: 'your-bucket-name', // [!code highlight]
  routes: {
    demo: route({
      fileTypes: ['image/*'],
    }),
  },
});
```

In the example above, we create the upload route `demo` for single images. You can create multiple routes for different purposes, like uploading more than one file.

</Step>

title: Upload Routes
---

Upload routes are where you define how the files are uploaded. To create a route, use the `route` function. You can create multiple routes for different purposes (e.g. images, videos). A basic example is below.

```ts
import { route } from 'better-upload/server';

route({
  fileTypes: ['image/*'], // Accepts all image types
  maxFileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 4, // 4MB
});
```

All routes have the following options:

- `fileTypes`: An array of file types to accept. Use any valid MIME type. Like `application/pdf` to accept PDF files. You can also use wildcards like `image/*` to accept all image types. By default, all file types are accepted.
- `maxFileSize`: The maximum file size in bytes. Default is 5MB.
- `signedUrlExpiresIn`: The time in seconds the upload signed URL is valid. Default is 120 seconds (2 minutes).

## Callbacks

When defining a route, you may want to run code before or after the upload. You can do this by using the callbacks.

### Before upload

The `onBeforeUpload` callback is called before the pre-signed URL is generated. Use this to run custom logic before uploading a file, such as auth and rate-limiting. You can also customize the S3 object key here.

Throw an `UploadFileError` to reject the file upload. This will also send the error message to the client.

```ts
import { route, UploadFileError } from 'better-upload/server';

route({
  onBeforeUpload: async ({ req, file, clientMetadata }) => {
    const user = await auth();

    if (!user) {
      throw new UploadFileError('Not logged in!');
    }

    return {
      objectKey: user.id,
    };
  },
});
```

You can return an object with the following properties:

- `objectKey`: The S3 object key. If not provided, a random key will be generated.
- `metadata`: Metadata to be passed to the `onAfterSignedUrl` callback.

The request and metadata sent from the client are also available.

### After generating signed URL

The `onAfterSignedUrl` callback is called after the pre-signed URL is generated. Use this to run custom logic after the URL is generated, such as logging and saving data.

Metadata from the `onBeforeUpload` callback is available, as well as metadata sent from the client.

```ts
import { route } from 'better-upload/server';

route({
  onAfterSignedUrl: async ({ req, file, metadata, clientMetadata }) => {
    console.log('After signed URL:', file.objectKey);

    return {
      metadata: {
        example: '123',
      },
    };
  },
});
```

You can return an object with the following properties:

- `metadata`: Metadata to be sent back to the client. Needs to be JSON serializable.

## Multiple files

By default, an upload route only accepts a single file. If you want to upload multiple files, set `multipleFiles` to `true`.

```ts
import { route } from 'better-upload/server';

route({
  maxFileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 4, // For each file
  multipleFiles: true, // [!code highlight]
  maxFiles: 4, // [!code highlight]
});
```

The callbacks are also a bit different when uploading multiple files. See the example below.

```ts
import { route } from 'better-upload/server';

route({
  multipleFiles: true,
  maxFiles: 4,
  onBeforeUpload: async ({ req, files, clientMetadata }) => {
    // files is an array

    return {
      generateObjectKey: ({ file }) => `files/${file.name}`,
    };
  },
  onAfterSignedUrl: async ({ req, files, metadata, clientMetadata }) => {
    // files is an array
  },
});
```

Both now get an array of files (`files`), instead of a single file (`file`).

`onBeforeUpload` now needs to return `generateObjectKey`, instead of just returning a string in `objectKey`.

## Router

The router is where you define all of your upload routes. To define a router you can use the `Router` type, then create a simple object.

```ts
import { route, type Router } from 'better-upload/server';

export const router: Router = {
  client: s3,
  bucketName: 'your-bucket-name',
  routes: {
    demo: route({
      fileTypes: ['image/*'],
    }),
  },
};
```

You can also just create it in the upload Route Handler, which is simpler.
